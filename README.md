# roc-aws-lambda-runtime

A custom runtime for AWS Lambda written in Roc using [basic-cli](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli).

See also [roc-aws-lambda](https://github.com/isaacvando/roc-aws-lambda), a Roc platform for AWS Lambda written in Rust.

## Usage

To write a Lambda, update `Handler.roc`:
```roc
handle : List U8 -> Task Str Str
handle = \_ ->
    Task.ok "Hello, World!"
```

The runtime code is in `bootstrap.roc`. It is compiled to a binary called `bootstrap` which Lambda runs to initialize the runtime. Once the runtime receives a request from Lambda, it calls `Handler.handle` to process the request.

To build a function, use the included script:
```bash
$ ./build.sh yourfunction.roc
```

Then deploy the Lambda to AWS with the deployment script:
```bash
$ ./deploy.sh yourfunction arn:aws:iam::{your_account_id}:role/{your_role_name}
```
or by manually uploading the `bootstrap.zip` generated by `build.sh` to the AWS Console.

## Local Testing
You can test your functions locally with `local.roc`. It will read input from stdin and pass it to the function:
```bash
echo some input | roc local.roc
Hello, World!
```
